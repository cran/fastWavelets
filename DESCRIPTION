Description: A lightweight package to compute Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet 
    Transform (MODWT) and À Trous Discrete Wavelet Transform by leveraging the 
    power of 'Rcpp' to make these operations fast. This package was designed for use in forecasting, and
    allows users avoid the inclusion of future data when performing wavelet decomposition of time series.
